# Market-Pulse
Dedicated to find the health of financial market based on indices tracked by Infi-flux's Portfolio DayBreak &amp; MidDay

Introducing Market Pulse: Trying to answer one simple question. What is the overall sentiment of the markets for the next day for particular intervals and if the market indices are moving in the same direction or not? Market Pulse is the first of its kind and is an honest experiment. Market Pulse is divided into two parts. The first part is the sentiment forecasts based on the forecasts of underlying products of Infi-flux -> DayBreak & MidDay.
Market Pulse is a simple experiment that takes the forecast of sector-dedicated indices from Infi-fluxâ€™s products DayBreak and MidDay and combines those sentiments by using the concept of Weighted Average sum based on the total market capitalization of those indices to give the overall market sentiment covered by those indices. 
The second part is the correlation heatmaps of the indices dedicated to markets NSE and BSE. That gives the correlation between the indices for the past 3 days. Whether they were moving in the same direction or the opposite direction?
